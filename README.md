Python Lottery scripts

I have created a random number generator for all the main lottery draws in the UK,
each draw has it's own script named:  <lottery name>-random-number-generator.py


example:

./euromillions-hot-picks-random-number-generator.py
./euromillions-random-number-generator.py
./national-lottery-hot-picks-random-number-generator.py
./national-lottery-random-number-generator.py
./set-for-life-random-number-generator.py
./thunderball-random-number-generator.py


The hotpicks scripts will ask you how many number you would like to generate,
either type 1 to 5 for Euromillions Hotpicks or 1 to 6 for National Lottery Hotpicks.

Feel free to run these, they are random numbers so there is no guarantees that any lines
will win a prize, but good luck.

Don't forget me if you do win big!!!!  :-)
